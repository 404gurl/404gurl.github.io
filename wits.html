                     <p><b>What path did you take to your career in Computer Science?</b></p>
                     <p>I took AP Computer Science in High School to avoid taking Calculus and loved it. I ended up majoring in it in college and after a wonderful internship experience, went on to work full time at Adobe! I've been working there for two years and have had an excellent experience so far. </p>
                     <p><b>What opportunities did you have that helped you get there?</b></p>
                     <p>When I was a sophomore in college I had the opportunity to go to the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing and it was mind-blowing to see so many other women in tech. I got to hand my resume out to major companies. I got a scholarship to go again as a junior, and got to expand my network and have interviews for internships as well. </p>
                     <p><b>Do you have any advice for girls aspiring to pursue a career in tech?</b></p>
                     <p>Don't be afraid to ask questions and be confused and don't forget to stop and celebrate your accomplishments.</p>
                     <p><b>What is your favorite part of your job?</b></p>
                     <p>Currently? I love the fact that Adobe is allowing me to step away from my regular job for 7 weeks to teach Girls Who Code!</p>
                     <p><b>If you could go back in time to your younger self and give them advice, what would you say?</b></p>
                     <p>Stop trying to fit what other people want out of you, you're happiest when you're authentically being yourself. </p>
                     <p><b>Do you have anything else you want to say about your story and inspiring girls to pursue a technology career in their future?</b></p>
                     <p>We need you! I'm sick of empty women's restrooms! </p>

                   <div class="formInfo">
                     <p><b>What path did you take to your career in Computer Science?</b></p>
                     <p>First, I graduated from primary school/high school. Then got into college and graduated with a Math degree and CS Minor. After college, applied for a more entry level tech job that I had the skills from my CS minor. After two years I applied for a higher level tech job at a purely technology company (Adobe) and I've now been here for 1.5 years.</p>
                     <p><b>What opportunities did you have that helped you get there?</b></p>
                     <p>Access to quality education and individualized help as I needed it. I was able to have parents who could pay for college which meant I had a less stressful college and post college experience than others. Additionally, my first tech job really is what gave me the experience to get my job at Adobe. Each opportunity I have gives me the experience and knowledge I need for another opportunity to present itself.</p>
                     <p><b>Do you have any advice for girls aspiring to pursue a career in tech?</b></p>
                     <p>Lean on other strong women. Simply put, women do really well together. This is not to say we can't do great with men as well, but our experiences and socialization are different than men's. Having supportive strong women around you can really tip the scales in a woman's favor when pursuing any opportunity. In tech or not, women are amazing. </p>
                     <p><b>What is your favorite part of your job?</b></p>
                     <p>Helping people. I have learned so much at my job and I use that knowledge to educate and resolve issues for all sorts of people. I love being able to make things easier or clearer for the people I work with. I can actually measure and see the impact of my work on a day to day basis which is incredibly satisfying.</p>
                     <p><b>If you could go back in time to your younger self and give them advice, what would you say?</b></p>
                     <p>Relax and stop comparing yourself to ANYONE else. No seriously, listen to me and knock it off! You absolutely can go and should only ever go at your own pace in life. I took a gap year between high school and college and I basically took a gap year between college and my first serious job. I'm grateful for where I am today and I didn't need to go at anyone else's pace to get here.</p>
                     <p><b>Do you have anything else you want to say about your story and inspiring girls to pursue a technology career in their future?</b></p>
                     <p>Take care of yourself and your dreams. Without one, the other will not succeed.</p>

                     <p><b>What path did you take to your career in Computer Science?</b></p>
                     <p>When I first entered college, I wanted to study Computer Science. However, after taking the first couple intro classes, I realized that I wanted to do something geared more towards working with people and understanding people. After taking a mobile application design class (where we learned basic principles of UX), I realized my passion for designing with purpose. That class eventually led me to where I am now, as a senior at the University of Washington studying Human Centered Design and Engineering. </p>
                     <p><b>What opportunities did you have that helped you get there?</b></p>
                     <p>Networking within my department has led me to my internship at Adobe. </p>

                     <p>Never stop searching for opportunities to learn and grow. Don't be afraid to reach out to those senior to you, they can lead you to more opportunities for growth. </p>
                     <p><b>What is your favorite part of your job?</b></p>
                     <p>I have the opportunity to work with a variety of different people with different backgrounds.</p>

                     <p><b>What path did you take to your career in Computer Science?</b></p>
                     <p>I initially studied International Studies before discovering Informatics at the University of Washington, which is what I graduated from. It's a multidisciplinary major that focuses on computer science, UX design, data science, cybersecurity, etc. I then worked at Nordstrom in their UX Design department and am a UX Designer/Front End Developer at Adobe.</p>
                     <p><b>What opportunities did you have that helped you get there?</b></p>
                     <p>Lots of networking! I talked to advisors, students and professors within the Informatics major when I was applying to get a better feel for the major and learn about what I needed to do for admission. And then when applying for jobs, went to meetups and reached out to people in the industry. Take advantage of people who you can learn from and are willing to help. It really is (mostly) about who you know.</p>
                     <p><b>Do you have any advice for girls aspiring to pursue a career in tech?</b></p>
                     <p>Tech is a broad field and more than just coding, so take time to explore different areas within it and when you find that thing you're passionate about, run with it. However, I am a strong believer that everybody should take 1 or 2 coding classes as they will go a long way in whatever field you pursue (even if it's not tech).</p>
                     <p><b>What is your favorite part of your job?</b></p>
                     <p>I'm challenged and excited by my work and the people around me everyday. </p>
                     <p><b>If you could go back in time to your younger self and give them advice, what would you say?</b></p>
                     <p>Don't get too stressed about your future and finding the "right" major and allow yourself to be confused at times. It all works out in the end.</p>
                     <p><b>Do you have anything else you want to say about your story and inspiring girls to pursue a technology career in their future?</b></p>
                     <p>Being a female in tech has its moments of intimidation, but more than anything it's an exciting and empowering field to work in and be able to encourage others to pursue. Trust me, it's worth all of those late nights of schoolwork. :)</p>

                   <div class="formInfo">
                     <p><b>What path did you take to your career in Computer Science?</b></p>
                     <p>On the surface my path might look somewhat "traditional" in that I went to an engineering school, moved to San Francisco after graduation (where the tech jobs were), and progressed through a variety of different roles and company types to ultimately hone in on what was the right fit for me. But, very few people from where I grew up navigated a path like this so I often felt like I was forging new territory. I really had to trust myself when it felt scary or risky, especially when I moved out of state. I think the word "intuitive" best describes my approach... I have always followed my heart in the choices I've made. I trusted my intuition when it came to decisions about which colleges to apply to and ultimately attend, which jobs I wanted that spoke to me at an emotional level, and when I needed to make hard decisions to leave a job that didn't feel right, no matter how lucrative it might have been. I like to push hard and take on new challenges just beyond my comfort zone, but sometimes this comes at a cost. I try to continually adjust my situation to keep the right balance between my career aspiration, my financial situation, my family, and my personal health (mental, physical, spiritual). But if I forget to listen to my intuition, it can take me a while to realize something is off or to get the courage to make a change. </p>
                     <p><b>What opportunities did you have that helped you get there?</b></p>
                     <p>I was extremely fortunate to attend MIT for college. As a middle class girl from a Florida public high school, MIT was like the land of milk & honey in terms of opportunities. I came into contact with a vast array of professors, graduate students, and undergraduate friends who have opened doors for me my entire life. For example, I studied under Prof. John Maeda for several years while he was still at the MIT Media Lab. He showed me how technology can be humanized when you blend it with the arts, and how it was possible to mix my creative and tech passions together into a career trajectory that wasn't traditionally just engineering or just art. I landed my first two jobs out of college because of connections through MIT, and then ultimately built on those networks over the years to continually expand my reach. So much of success is based on relationships with other people, not strictly how "good" we are at executing a job. When you can combine the two together, anything is possible.</p>
                     <p><b>Do you have any advice for girls aspiring to pursue a career in tech?</b></p>
                     <p>It may sound corny, but first you have to believe in yourself. Confidence goes so far in this industry, and you can't be afraid to speak up, to sit in the front row or to take that seat at the table. How you show up, how you project yourself, and how you tell your story or vision is just as important as how "good" your code/spec/PRD/etc. is (maybe more). It's not an easy industry to be in, as a woman. The implicit biases are insidious and pervasive. But there are just as many amazing advocates, sponsors, and mentors in the ranks as there are evil people. The good people genuinely believe in the value women bring to this industry -- as humans, not just as a gender. As such, my second piece of advice is to also find someone who believes in you. Find them early and don't let them out of your grip. They will help you soar.</p>
                     <p><b>What is your favorite part of your job?</b></p>
                     <p>I love that I get to imagine the future of our creative tools and how advances in technology like Machine Learning can take them to places not previously possible. And I also love that I'm not just dreaming about that future, but I'm involved in figuring out how to make it a reality. At Adobe, I get work on the tools creative people use to make the most amazing pieces of work, and it's very fulfilling to see the impact.</p>
                     <p><b>If you could go back in time to your younger self and give them advice, what would you say?</b></p>
                     <p>I wish I had paced myself better in my twenties, and taken better care of myself. I realize now that it's possible to be successful without burning the candle at both ends. The tech industry takes whatever you're willing to give -- it won't say No. You have to learn to say No yourself. I didn't realize the long term impact that my crazy hours, insane travel schedule, too much drinking and bad food choices combined with all the stress of my job would have on me. I'm still dealing with health issues that started 15 years ago when I prioritized work over everything else. I also lost time with friends and family. My father passed away in my early thirties and I will never get that time back with him again. Those were hard lessons to learn.</p>
                     <p><b>Do you have anything else you want to say about your story and inspiring girls to pursue a technology career in their future?</b></p>
                     <p>I don't know if this is inspiring, but I will say it anyways... there will be some very awesome highs and some very low lows in any career that you pursue, tech or otherwise... Sometimes the lows will feel personal, eroding your confidence or self-worth. Don't lose yourself in those moments. Seek and ask for help, find a coach or mentor, listen to a podcast, take a training, get outside for a walk in the woods, paint, dance, do whatever it takes to pull yourself back up and get on your feet again. There are so many resources out there if you just look around. It's never you against the world, even though it might feel like that at times. For every one person who tears you down, there are many many more who want to build you up... So keep your head up, and always seek the light!
